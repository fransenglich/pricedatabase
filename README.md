# Python/Excel-produced price database

This code was a project as an intern. It opened a set of Excel files, and produced another Excel file that the consultants used for estimating costs of objects in city planning. **Pandas** was largely used, somewhat convoluted arrangement of data, and index adjustment of prices. The produced result had about 2500 prices.

The code was regression tested using base lining, see **test_code.py**, and came with user-oriented documentation for using and installing the project.

To produce this, I worked with two senior leaders in order to understand their needs and produce a result that was useful to them. We also requested data from external parties in order to build the price database.

The project was proprietary to the company, and therefore the data files and hence original repository is not here, albeit the code that was written by me exclusively.
