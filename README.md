# Python/Excel produced price database

This code was a project as an intern. It opened a set of Excel files, and produced another Excel file that the consultants used for estimating costs of objects in city planning.

The code was regression tested using base lining, see **test_code.py**, and came with documentation.

The project was proprietary to the company, and therefore the data files and hence original repository is not here, albeit the code.
